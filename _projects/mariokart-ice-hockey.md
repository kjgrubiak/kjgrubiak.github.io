This was our final project for our Deep Learning class. We had to create players that would play 2v2 ice hockey against other teams in the class. The game took place within SuperPyTuxKart (an open source version of MarioKart). We used CNNs implemented in PyTorch to track the location of the puck and a custom controller to both score and defend. Our grades were entirely based on how our team performed against other teams. We took 2nd place!
