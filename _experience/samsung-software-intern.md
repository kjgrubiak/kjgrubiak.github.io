After my first year at UVA, I was given the opportunity to travel to Gyeonggi-Do, Korea to intern with Samsung Electronics. Part of the UVA Global Internships Program, I went with six other UVA students to work for the Korean electronic giant. We were separated into two teams, and my team worked in the Software R&D Center, specifically with their Core IP team. Lasting four weeks, we were given projects to expand our knowledge in the field. My partner (Willie) and I studied the new ARM processor architecture, familiarizing ourselves with how it works and its modifications from its old 32-bit model. In addition, we researched ARM's TrustZone technology, and gave weekly presentations to the senior engineers with our findings.

During my time in the office, I took the opportunity to speak to my mentors about their work, their experience with Samsung, and their families. They taught us their business etiquette, business culture, and how large corporations work. On a few occasions, my boss/mentor and other team members took Willie and I out for dinner and drinks for a more casual conversation.

In addition to the amazing work experience, I also experienced the greatness that is Korean culture. Each weekend, the seven of us would travel to the nearby city of Seoul to explore. We checked out ancient Korean castles, fortresses, and many other historical landmarks. We sampled all their different food and entertainment whenever possible. In fact, Samsung sent us on a field trip where we were given the opportunity to cook Korean food, try on cultural clothes, and visit many more historical sites. It truly was a phenomenal experience, one that I cannot ever forget. Korea is a beautiful country and their culture is truly amazing.
