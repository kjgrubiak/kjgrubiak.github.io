I've been practicing Mindfulness Meditation every day for 20 minutes a day since I was 18 years old. UVa is full of people double majoring, doing every extra curricular possible, all while saving the planet. In other words, it's full of overachievers. Being completely immersed in that type of a social and academic environment can be stressful. My meditation practice helped me cope with that stress and successfully adjust to the chaos of college. The problem? **Meditation wasn't socially acceptable**. When I told people that I meditated, they usually assumed I was either weird, a Buddhist, or that I regularly hum to myself while sitting on the ground. My practice is quite the opposite: it's run through an iPhone app, it's entirely secular, and it involves zero humming! I wanted to share the benefits of the practice with other students, educate them on its benefits, and make it a more socially-accepted activity, so **I took action**.

**I started a university-sponsored organization called Mediation for Students** during my third year of school at UVA. I gave several talks around Grounds to promote both the practice and the new organization. Through these educational talks, we gained over 200 signups within the first two months of operation. The organization was comprised of myself as the President and four other board members. Together, we organized regular club meetings to learn about meditation, hosted guest speakers, and provided resources to the students to make meditating easier or more accessible. A junior member of the board assumed my role after I graduated, and Meditation for Students is still running as of 2020.
