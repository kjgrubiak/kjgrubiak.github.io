I was a software engineering summer intern for Intel's Content Protection Group. My team specifically was tasked at managing the security of Intel's graphics drivers such that any graphical content played on an Intel processor was protected from corruption or theft.

I spent the summer writing C++ to mitigate the issue of privillege escalation in the kernel mode driver. I finished the project early, so I was also assigned to develop a test suite for some of the driver code. I also finished the test suite, which achieved greater than 90% code coverage. I finished the summer by writing detailed documentation on the new code, so I could cleanly hand off my work before returning back to school!
