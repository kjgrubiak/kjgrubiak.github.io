        Wow, you made it all the way here? You're sure you shouldn't be doing something else? Ok... I grew up in Kansas City, KS.
        I graduated with <i>high distinction</i> from the University of Virginia, where I double majored in Computer and Electrical Engineering,
        and minored in Business. I did this while launching <i>Meditation for Students</i>, a university-sponsored
        student organization to encourage the proliferation of meditation practices to help students better manage the chaos of attending an elite, academic
        university. The organization has over 300 members and is still running three years later.

        After graduating from U.Va., I worked as a Functional Safety Systems Engineer and Architect in Intel Corporation's
        Autonomous Driving Group. I learned a great deal about how safety-critical software and hardware systems operate, and how
        to make decisions that could impact the safety of hundreds of thousands of people. I was the most junior engineer by about eight
        years; still, I operated as the technical lead for a team of five senior engineers. Together, our team delivered one of three major
        components in Intel's platform on-time. I was promoted to "senior engineer" one year into my career and was told I was on track to be a Principle Engineer.

        I left Intel to further my understanding of AI through a M.S. in Computer Science at UT Austin, and I'll graduate in December 2020.
        I'm currently solving interesting problems in Data Science on a contractual basis, while playing around with some startup ideas.
        I love developing my understanding of the world in a broad, systematic way, and I plan to leverage that understanding to
        create an organization that solves meaingful problems in an ethically responsible way.
